# 04 Web APIs Code Quiz
## Description

The project is to build a webpage that runs a quiz game. The quiz game will prompt the user to answer some questions and will be scored out of a 1000 based on thier answers and how fast they complete it

## Installation
To start this game, you simple load the page and click start. Once you do it will start a timer and you will be prompted with questions that need to be answered by clicking the buttons. Please note that choosing a wrong answer or CLICKING ANYTHING but the answer itself will count as a wrong answer and will subract 20 from the timer. The game ends once all questions have been answered and the game will display your score.

Note: Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete the critiria to save initials and the score into local memory.

## Usage

You can use this code to look at how the timer behaves. Also one can see the event listeners and how using event listeners requires chaining functions so that each event listeners is used to chain onto the next so that all the listeners don't activiate all at once.

## Credits
For this challenge assignment, I used code from the miniproject from week 4 Web API section. It was used to set up the timer, start button listeners, and a foundation to set up the page itself in order to create and remove buttons to be used in the quiz game.
